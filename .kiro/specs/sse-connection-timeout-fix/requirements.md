# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses the SSE (Server-Sent Events) connection timeout issue where MCP clients connecting via SSE keep loading and eventually timeout. The server establishes the SSE connection successfully but clients are not receiving the expected MCP protocol initialization messages, causing them to hang indefinitely waiting for the handshake to complete.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an MCP client connecting via SSE transport, I want to receive proper MCP protocol initialization messages after establishing the SSE connection, so that I can complete the handshake and start using MCP tools.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a client connects to the SSE endpoint THEN the system SHALL send an MCP initialization message following the MCP protocol specification
2. WHEN the SSE connection is established THEN the system SHALL immediately send the server capabilities and information to the client
3. WHEN the client receives the initialization message THEN the system SHALL be ready to process subsequent MCP requests over the SSE connection
4. WHEN the initialization is complete THEN the client SHALL be able to discover and call MCP tools without timeout issues

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an MCP client, I want the SSE transport to properly handle the MCP protocol handshake sequence, so that I can interact with the server using standard MCP protocol messages.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the SSE connection is established THEN the system SHALL send an `initialize` response message with server capabilities
2. WHEN the client sends MCP requests via the SSE message endpoint THEN the system SHALL process them and send responses via SSE events
3. WHEN the system processes MCP requests THEN the responses SHALL be sent as `mcp-response` events over the SSE connection
4. WHEN the handshake is complete THEN the system SHALL maintain the connection for ongoing MCP communication

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer debugging SSE connections, I want comprehensive logging of the SSE initialization process, so that I can troubleshoot connection and handshake issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an SSE connection is established THEN the system SHALL log the initialization message being sent to the client
2. WHEN MCP messages are processed over SSE THEN the system SHALL log both incoming requests and outgoing responses
3. WHEN initialization fails THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information with correlation IDs
4. WHEN the handshake completes successfully THEN the system SHALL log confirmation of the successful initialization

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an MCP client, I want the SSE transport to be compatible with standard MCP client libraries, so that I can use existing MCP tooling without modifications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using standard MCP client libraries THEN the SSE transport SHALL work without requiring client-side modifications
2. WHEN the client expects standard MCP protocol messages THEN the system SHALL provide them in the correct format and sequence
3. WHEN the client sends standard MCP requests THEN the system SHALL process them identically to HTTP transport
4. WHEN responses are sent THEN they SHALL follow the same MCP message format as HTTP transport
