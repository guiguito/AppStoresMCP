# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Modify SSE transport to send automatic initialization messages
  - Update `handleSSEConnection` method to automatically trigger MCP initialization after connection establishment
  - Create `sendInitializationMessage` method that generates synthetic initialize request and processes it
  - Add initialization state tracking to SSEConnection interface to prevent duplicate initialization
  - Ensure initialization happens before heartbeat messages are sent
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3_

- [x] 2. Implement synthetic MCP initialize request creation
  - Create `createInitializeRequest` method that generates proper MCP initialize request with protocol version and client info
  - Set appropriate default values for protocolVersion ('2025-03-26') and synthetic client information
  - Ensure the synthetic request follows the same format as real client initialize requests
  - Add proper request ID generation for the synthetic initialize request
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 2.1, 4.2_

- [x] 3. Integrate initialization flow with existing MCP handler
  - Modify SSE transport to use the existing MCP handler's `handleRequest` method for processing initialize requests
  - Ensure the initialize response includes proper server capabilities and information
  - Verify that the response format matches what MCP clients expect for SSE transport
  - Test that the existing MCP handler's initialize method works correctly with synthetic requests
  - _Requirements: 1.3, 2.2, 4.3_

- [x] 4. Add comprehensive logging for SSE initialization process
  - Add structured logging when SSE connection is established and initialization begins
  - Log the synthetic initialize request being created and processed
  - Log the initialize response being sent to the client via SSE
  - Add error logging for initialization failures with detailed error information and correlation IDs
  - Log successful completion of the initialization handshake
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4_

- [x] 5. Implement error handling for initialization failures
  - Add try-catch blocks around initialization process to handle failures gracefully
  - Create specific error responses for initialization failures that are sent via SSE
  - Ensure connections are properly cleaned up if initialization fails
  - Add timeout handling for initialization process to prevent hanging connections
  - Test error scenarios like MCP handler unavailable or malformed responses
  - _Requirements: 3.3, 1.4_

- [x] 6. Update SSE connection state management
  - Add `isInitialized` flag to SSEConnection interface to track initialization status
  - Modify connection cleanup to handle initialization state properly
  - Ensure that subsequent MCP requests are only processed after successful initialization
  - Add optional request queuing mechanism for requests received before initialization completes
  - _Requirements: 1.3, 2.3_

- [x] 7. Write unit tests for SSE initialization functionality
  - Create tests for automatic initialization message sending on connection establishment
  - Test synthetic initialize request creation with proper format and parameters
  - Test integration with MCP handler for processing initialize requests
  - Test error handling scenarios during initialization process
  - Test that initialization state is properly tracked and managed
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 2.1, 2.2_

- [x] 8. Create integration tests for complete SSE handshake flow
  - Write end-to-end test that establishes SSE connection and verifies initialization message is received
  - Test that clients can discover tools after successful initialization
  - Test that MCP requests work properly after initialization handshake
  - Create test that simulates real MCP client behavior to verify compatibility
  - Test timeout prevention by verifying connections don't hang indefinitely
  - _Requirements: 1.4, 2.4, 4.1, 4.4_

- [x] 9. Add configuration options for SSE initialization behavior
  - Add `autoInitialize` configuration option (default: true) to enable/disable automatic initialization
  - Add `initializationTimeout` configuration option to control initialization timeout duration
  - Update SSETransportConfig interface with new configuration options
  - Ensure backward compatibility with existing SSE transport configuration
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2_

- [x] 10. Update documentation and examples for fixed SSE transport
  - Update README.md with information about the SSE initialization fix
  - Add examples showing how SSE connections now work properly with MCP clients
  - Document the new configuration options for SSE initialization
  - Create troubleshooting section for SSE connection issues
  - Update API documentation to reflect the automatic initialization behavior
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.4_
