# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a Node.js TypeScript web MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that exposes app store scraping functionality through HTTP transport. The server will integrate with existing Google Play Store and Apple App Store scraping libraries to provide MCP tools for retrieving app information, reviews, and metadata from both app stores.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer using MCP clients, I want to access Google Play Store scraping functionality through MCP tools, so that I can retrieve app information, reviews, and metadata programmatically.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the MCP server receives a request for Google Play Store data THEN the system SHALL use the google-play-scraper library to fetch the requested information
2. WHEN a client requests app details from Google Play Store THEN the system SHALL return structured app metadata including title, description, ratings, and developer information
3. WHEN a client requests app reviews from Google Play Store THEN the system SHALL return paginated review data with ratings and text content
4. WHEN a client requests app search results from Google Play Store THEN the system SHALL return a list of matching apps with basic metadata

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer using MCP clients, I want to access Apple App Store scraping functionality through MCP tools, so that I can retrieve iOS app information and reviews programmatically.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the MCP server receives a request for Apple App Store data THEN the system SHALL use the app-store-scraper library to fetch the requested information
2. WHEN a client requests app details from Apple App Store THEN the system SHALL return structured app metadata including title, description, ratings, and developer information
3. WHEN a client requests app reviews from Apple App Store THEN the system SHALL return paginated review data with ratings and text content
4. WHEN a client requests app search results from Apple App Store THEN the system SHALL return a list of matching apps with basic metadata

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the MCP server to support both Streamable HTTP and SSE transport, so that it can be accessed by both modern and legacy MCP clients.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the server starts THEN the system SHALL initialize both HTTP transport following MCP Streamable HTTP specifications AND SSE transport for legacy client compatibility
2. WHEN a client connects via HTTP THEN the system SHALL handle MCP protocol messages over the HTTP connection
3. WHEN a client connects via SSE THEN the system SHALL handle MCP protocol messages over Server-Sent Events transport
4. WHEN the server receives requests THEN the system SHALL process them according to MCP transport protocol standards regardless of transport type
5. WHEN the server responds to requests THEN the system SHALL format responses according to MCP message specifications for the appropriate transport

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the MCP server to be built with TypeScript and Node.js, so that it provides type safety and runs efficiently in JavaScript environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the project is built THEN the system SHALL compile TypeScript code without errors
2. WHEN the server runs THEN the system SHALL execute on Node.js runtime environment
3. WHEN developers work with the code THEN the system SHALL provide TypeScript type definitions for all public interfaces
4. WHEN the server handles requests THEN the system SHALL validate input parameters using TypeScript types

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a client application, I want to discover available MCP tools, so that I can understand what app store scraping functionality is available.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a client requests available tools THEN the system SHALL return a list of all supported MCP tools
2. WHEN a client requests tool schemas THEN the system SHALL provide parameter definitions and return types for each tool
3. WHEN a client queries tool capabilities THEN the system SHALL describe the functionality of Google Play Store and App Store scraping tools
4. WHEN the server starts THEN the system SHALL register all scraping tools with the MCP framework

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want the server to handle errors gracefully, so that clients receive meaningful error messages when scraping operations fail.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN scraping operations encounter network errors THEN the system SHALL return structured error responses with appropriate error codes
2. WHEN invalid parameters are provided THEN the system SHALL validate inputs and return descriptive error messages
3. WHEN app store APIs are unavailable THEN the system SHALL handle timeouts and return appropriate error responses
4. WHEN rate limiting occurs THEN the system SHALL communicate rate limit status to clients through error responses

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer using MCP tools, I want to receive raw data models from the underlying scraping libraries, so that I can access all available information without data loss through transformation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a client requests app details THEN the system SHALL return the complete raw response from google-play-scraper or app-store-scraper libraries
2. WHEN a client requests app reviews THEN the system SHALL return the unmodified review data structures from the underlying libraries
3. WHEN a client requests search results THEN the system SHALL return the full search response objects without field filtering or transformation
4. WHEN the system processes scraper responses THEN the system SHALL preserve all metadata, nested objects, and optional fields from the original library responses

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer using MCP tools, I want access to all available functionality from both scraping libraries, so that I can utilize the complete feature set without limitations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the server initializes THEN the system SHALL expose MCP tools for all public methods available in google-play-scraper library
2. WHEN the server initializes THEN the system SHALL expose MCP tools for all public methods available in app-store-scraper library
3. WHEN a client discovers tools THEN the system SHALL list all comprehensive scraping capabilities including advanced search, category browsing, developer information, and similar apps functionality
4. WHEN new methods are added to the underlying libraries THEN the system SHALL be easily extensible to include new tools without architectural changes

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a developer using MCP tools, I want to specify country and language parameters for app store data retrieval, so that I can access localized content and region-specific information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a client requests Google Play Store data THEN the system SHALL accept optional language and country parameters to retrieve localized content
2. WHEN a client requests Apple App Store data THEN the system SHALL accept optional country parameters to retrieve region-specific content
3. WHEN language or country parameters are provided THEN the system SHALL pass these parameters to the underlying scraping libraries
4. WHEN language or country parameters are invalid THEN the system SHALL return validation errors with descriptive messages
5. WHEN language or country parameters are omitted THEN the system SHALL use default values (language: 'en', country: 'us')
6. WHEN the system validates parameters THEN language codes SHALL follow ISO 639-1 format (2-letter lowercase) AND country codes SHALL follow ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 format (2-letter lowercase)

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to deploy the MCP server using Docker, so that I can easily run it in containerized environments with consistent dependencies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Docker image is built THEN the system SHALL include all necessary Node.js dependencies and TypeScript compilation
2. WHEN the container starts THEN the system SHALL expose the HTTP port for MCP client connections
3. WHEN the container runs THEN the system SHALL execute the MCP server with proper environment configuration
4. WHEN deploying to different environments THEN the system SHALL support configuration through environment variables
