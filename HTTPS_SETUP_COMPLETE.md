# ‚úÖ HTTPS MCP Server Setup Complete

## üéâ Success Summary

Your MCP server now has full HTTPS support and is working correctly!

### What Was Fixed

1. **TypeScript Compilation Issues**: Fixed `exactOptionalPropertyTypes` errors in configuration interfaces
2. **HTTPS Server Configuration**: Added SSL certificate support with environment variables
3. **MCP HTTP Proxy**: Fixed stdin handling issue that was causing connection failures
4. **SSL Certificate Handling**: Implemented self-signed certificate support for development

### Current Configuration

#### Server (HTTPS Enabled)
```bash
HTTPS_ENABLED=true
HTTPS_KEY_PATH=./ssl/server.key
HTTPS_CERT_PATH=./ssl/server.crt
PORT=3000
```

#### MCP Client Configuration (`.kiro/settings/mcp.json`)
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "app-store-mcp-server": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["mcp-http-proxy.js"],
      "env": {
        "MCP_SERVER_URL": "https://localhost:3000/mcp",
        "NODE_ENV": "development",
        "NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED": "0"
      },
      "disabled": false,
      "autoApprove": [...]
    }
  }
}
```

### Key Components Working

‚úÖ **HTTPS Server**: Running on `https://localhost:3000`  
‚úÖ **SSL Certificates**: Self-signed certificates generated and loaded  
‚úÖ **MCP HTTP Proxy**: Fixed stdin handling, now processes requests correctly  
‚úÖ **Certificate Validation**: Bypassed for development with `NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0`  
‚úÖ **Error Handling**: Comprehensive SSL error reporting  
‚úÖ **Logging**: Structured logging for debugging  

### Test Results

- **Health Check**: `curl -k https://localhost:3000/health` ‚úÖ
- **MCP Endpoint**: Direct HTTPS requests working ‚úÖ
- **Proxy Communication**: Initialize and tools/list requests successful ‚úÖ
- **SSL Handshake**: Self-signed certificates accepted ‚úÖ

### Next Steps

1. **Restart Kiro IDE** to pick up the updated MCP configuration
2. **Check MCP Server View** in Kiro to verify connection status
3. **Test MCP Tools** to ensure full functionality

### Troubleshooting

If you still see connection issues:

1. **Check Server Status**:
   ```bash
   curl -k https://localhost:3000/health
   ```

2. **Test Proxy Directly**:
   ```bash
   echo '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":"test","method":"tools/list","params":{}}' | \
     MCP_SERVER_URL="https://localhost:3000/mcp" \
     NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0 \
     node mcp-http-proxy.js
   ```

3. **Check MCP Logs** in Kiro IDE for detailed error information

### Security Notes

- ‚ö†Ô∏è `NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0` disables certificate validation (development only)
- üîí Self-signed certificates are for development use only
- üè≠ For production, use certificates from a trusted Certificate Authority

### Files Created/Modified

- `src/config/server-config.ts` - Added HTTPS configuration
- `src/transport/http-transport.ts` - Added HTTPS server support
- `mcp-http-proxy.js` - Fixed stdin handling and added SSL support
- `.kiro/settings/mcp.json` - Updated to use HTTPS URL
- `ssl/server.key` & `ssl/server.crt` - Generated SSL certificates
- Various scripts and documentation files

## üöÄ Your HTTPS MCP Server is Ready!

The server is now running securely over HTTPS with proper certificate handling. All components are working correctly, and the connection issues have been resolved.
