# Advanced Guide to iOS App Store Keyword Optimization (Manual ASO)

**Introduction:**
Optimizing your app’s visibility on the iOS App Store is crucial, as **over 65% of downloads occur directly after a search**. This guide provides a step-by-step methodology to boost downloads via keyword optimization **without relying on paid ASO tools**. Instead, you will learn how to **manually research keywords**, **scrape competitor data**, **track rankings**, and continually refine your strategy. The process applies to **any app category**, focusing on fundamentals that hold true across the board. Follow these steps to craft an effective keyword strategy using only the App Store itself and basic analysis techniques.

## Step 1: Research High-Traffic Keywords Manually

Begin by building a comprehensive list of keywords that are both **relevant to your app** and likely to have **high search volume**. Since you won’t use third-party ASO platforms, leverage free, manual methods to find popular search terms:

* **Brainstorm User Search Terms:** Put yourself in the shoes of your target users. List words and phrases they might type to find an app like yours. Consider the problems your app solves and the language your audience uses. **Understanding user intent is key** – think features, benefits, and synonyms related to your app’s core purpose. For example, if you have a calorie tracking app, users might search *“calorie counter,” “diet tracker,” “food log,”* etc.
* **Use App Store Auto‑Suggest:** On the App Store (or its web search), start typing your seed keywords and note the auto-complete suggestions. These suggestions represent **queries frequently searched by users**, and their order often correlates with popularity (the higher on the list, the more popular). Jot down these suggested phrases – they can reveal high-traffic long-tails and related terms. Repeat this for multiple relevant seeds to gather a broad set of potential keywords.
* **Leverage Apple Search Ads (ASA) for Insights:** You can use Apple’s own Search Ads interface as a free keyword research tool. By initiating (but not actually running) an ASA campaign, you gain access to Apple’s keyword planner. Enter a few base keywords and observe the **suggested keywords and their “Search Popularity” scores** provided by Apple. This popularity metric is a direct indicator from Apple on how often users search for a term. It’s an invaluable signal for identifying high-traffic keywords without third-party tools. (For example, if Apple’s tool shows a term has a popularity of 80/100, you know it’s highly searched.)
* **Check Web Search Trends (Secondary):** While the App Store is unique, general web search interest can still hint at what people want. Using tools like **Google Keyword Planner** or **Google Trends** can help validate demand for certain terms in various regions. If a keyword related to your app has tens of thousands of Google searches monthly (especially for app-related queries), it likely has significant App Store volume too. Use this to prioritize keywords – but always ensure the terms are *app-specific* (e.g. “best **budget app**” might be relevant, whereas a generic Google query like “budget tips” is less so).
* **Aim for Relevance + Volume:** High traffic is useless if the keyword doesn’t match your app. Focus on keywords that clearly describe your app’s functionality or category **and** appear to be popular. It’s often wise to include a mix of broad high-volume terms and specific niche terms. Broad terms (e.g. “fitness”) have huge search volume but also high competition, whereas more specific ones (e.g. “5K run tracker”) have lower volume but less competition. **In the App Store, around 70% of search queries are long-tail** (multi-word) with higher conversion intent, so capturing a variety of specific phrases can drive highly qualified users. Early on, favor mid-tier or long-tail keywords that you can rank for, rather than ultra-competitive single words. This balanced approach ensures you target terms with traffic you have a realistic chance to convert.

By the end of this research phase, you should have a substantial keyword list. Next, we’ll refine it by analyzing what **competitors** in your niche are doing.

## Step 2: Analyze Competitors’ Keywords (Manual Scraping)

Your competitors can be a goldmine for keyword ideas. Apps similar to yours have already invested in ASO; by examining their listings, you can uncover keywords you might have missed and gauge which terms are effectively used in your category. Here’s how to conduct a competitor keyword analysis without special tools:

1. **Identify Top Competitor Apps:** Search the App Store for broad terms related to your app and note which apps consistently rank at the top. Also check the top charts or category listings for your app’s category. Compile a list of at least 5–10 close competitors (more if possible). Include both big players and niche apps – this will give a range of keyword strategies. For example, if you have a meditation app, your list might include popular ones like “Calm” or “Headspace” as well as emerging apps in the Health & Fitness category.
2. **Scrape and Record Their Metadata:** For each competitor, gather their **Title (App Name)**, **Subtitle**, and possibly a snippet of their **Description**. These text elements often contain their targeted keywords. The simplest manual way is to open each app’s page on the App Store web (or iTunes Preview) and copy the title, subtitle, and first lines of the description. If you have some technical ability, consider using Apple’s official **iTunes Search API** to automate this: for example, you can query the API by app name or ID to retrieve metadata in JSON format. Many ASO practitioners “scrape” the App Store by querying such endpoints for competitor info. Save all the collected text into a document or spreadsheet.
3. **Extract and Compare Keywords:** Now, comb through the compiled competitor texts to identify recurring words and interesting phrases. Look for **keyword trends** – terms that appear across multiple competitors’ titles/subtitles. These are likely important keywords for the genre. Also note unique keywords: maybe one competitor found a niche term that others haven’t used. Create a list of all distinct keywords found in competitors’ metadata (excluding very common words like “the”, “app”, etc.). You can do this by eye or by using simple text analysis (e.g. paste all text into a word frequency counter). The goal is to highlight which words are popular in your niche and spot **gaps** – relevant keywords that some competitors rank for but others (including you) do not. *For instance, you might discover that most top meditation apps use the word “sleep” in their subtitle (indicating high user interest in sleep meditation), while one app heavily emphasizes “anxiety relief” which could be an underserved search term.*
4. **Examine Competitor Descriptions and Reviews (Qualitative Insight):** While the iOS description isn’t indexed for search ranking, competitors often mention features and use case keywords there that reflect what they think users care about. Scan their descriptions for additional keyword ideas or phrases (especially if your app will also be on Google Play, where description keywords matter more). **User reviews** are another valuable resource – check what terms users use to describe features or problems. If many users of a competitor mention a particular term (e.g. “fasting tracker” in a diet app’s reviews), that term has mindshare and might be worth targeting. In fact, **recurring terms in competitors’ user reviews can reveal what users are searching for or value**. Add any promising new keywords from descriptions or reviews to your list, but ensure they align with your app’s actual features (don’t target a keyword for a feature you lack).
5. **Benchmark Competitor Keyword Usage:** As a final step, note how and where competitors place their keywords. Do they front-load important terms in the title? Do subtitles complement the title with different keywords? This can inform how you structure your own metadata in the next step. Also observe if any competitor seems to be “stuffing” keywords unnaturally – often a sign of desperation or outdated practice. You’ll want to strike a balance between keyword inclusion and readability.

By analyzing competitors, you uncover **valuable keyword opportunities** – both the “must-haves” that everyone uses and the **untapped niches** that competitors overlooked. With your expanded keyword list in hand, you can now strategically integrate these terms into your app’s metadata.

## Step 3: Optimize Your App Metadata for Discoverability

Now that you have a pool of researched keywords, the next step is to **strategically place them into your app’s metadata**: the Title, Subtitle, and Keyword field (and, to a lesser extent, the description). Proper structuring of these fields will maximize your app’s chances of appearing in relevant searches. Keep in mind that Apple’s search algorithm indexes **only certain fields** for keywords – specifically the **app title, subtitle, and the 100-character keyword field**. (Visual assets and the description are **not** used for search ranking on iOS, but they do affect conversion.) Below are best practices for each element:

* **App Title (Name) – 30 characters, highest weight:** This is the most critical text for ASO. Use the limited 30 characters to **include your brand name and one or two of the most valuable keywords** that describe your app’s core function. Aim to craft a title that balances branding with search optimization. For example, *“FitTrack – Workout & Step Counter”* blends a brand (“FitTrack”) with two major keywords (“Workout” and “Step Counter”). Placing important keywords right at the beginning can slightly help (and ensures they’re visible even if the title is truncated in search results). **Do not repeat any keyword in the title that you plan to use elsewhere** – repetition doesn’t boost ranking on iOS. Instead, use that precious space to cover unique high-priority terms. Ensure the title still reads naturally; a coherent name will improve user click-through and trust.
* **Subtitle – 30 characters, second highest weight:** The subtitle appears under the title in App Store search results and on the product page. Use it to **highlight your app’s main benefit or features** while incorporating additional important keywords *not already used in the title*. Think of the subtitle as a tagline that can capture other top keywords. Continuing the example, if the title used “workout” and “step counter,” the subtitle might target related terms: e.g. *“Fitness Plans & Calorie Tracker”*. Here we introduced “Fitness” and “Calorie Tracker” as new keywords, describing more of the app’s offerings. Like the title, make sure the subtitle is readable and appealing to users (it should make sense as a phrase). **Avoid duplicating words from the title in the subtitle**, as it won’t improve ranking and wastes space. Apple will only index a given keyword once; it gives full weight to the occurrence in the most important field (title > subtitle > keywords) and ignores duplicates. So use the subtitle to **complement** the title: cover secondary keywords that are still highly relevant.
* **Keyword Field – 100 characters (hidden), supplementary weight:** The keyword field is not user-facing, but it is crucial for search indexing. Here you can include all other relevant keywords that didn’t fit in your title or subtitle. When crafting this field:

  * **Use comma-separated keywords without spaces** (e.g. `budget,finance,money,tracker`) to maximize character use. Don’t include the same word twice; use singular forms (Apple typically matches plural searches to the singular keyword).
  * **Don’t include any keywords already used in your title or subtitle** – that would be redundant. Use this space for additional terms only. Also, there’s no need to add your app’s category name (e.g. “game” or “finance”) or generic words like “free” or “app”; Apple automatically associates many of those with your app.
  * **Avoid needless characters**: Omit articles (“the”, “and”) and punctuation. Don’t use special characters or emojis here – they don’t help in search. Use digits for numbers instead of spelling them out to save space (e.g. “7” instead of “seven”).
  * **Focus on single words** rather than phrases. The App Store algorithm will **combine keywords from all fields to match search queries**, effectively generating thousands of phrase combinations from your set of words. For example, if your keyword list has “budget” and “planner” as separate entries, Apple can match your app to the query “budget planner”. Thus, you rarely need to put multi-word phrases as a single entry. (Only consider a phrase if it’s a highly specific search that’s more than the sum of its parts, e.g. a branded term or a common two-word expression that users search as a chunk.)
  * **Stay relevant and compliant**: Every keyword should accurately relate to your app’s content. Don’t include competitor app names or trademarks – even though users don’t see the keyword field, Apple reviewers do, and **using other brands can get your app rejected or removed**. Also avoid profanity or anything against guidelines in this field. Irrelevant keywords might bring a few extra impressions, but those users will bounce, harming your conversion and ratings in the long run. It’s better to attract the *right* users.
* **Description (up to 4000 characters, not indexed for search):** Although the description won’t help your search rankings on iOS, it plays a **critical role in converting users who discovered your app**. Many users read the description to confirm your app has what they want before downloading. So, you should still **incorporate your major keywords and themes naturally in the description text** – not for Apple’s algorithm, but for the **user’s eyes**. When a user sees the exact words they searched for echoed in your description, it reinforces that your app is likely what they’re looking for. For example, if a user searched “meal planner” and your description immediately mentions “This app is a comprehensive meal planner and nutrition tracker…”, it creates a strong connection. Write an engaging, clear description that highlights your app’s features, benefits, and unique value. Use the first 1–3 lines (the part shown before the “more” link) to **hit the key points and keywords** that matter most to your audience. Throughout the description, avoid *keyword stuffing* (repeating terms unnaturally); instead, aim for a friendly yet informative tone that happens to include your important terms in context. Remember, the description’s job is to turn impressions into installs by convincing the user – it should assure them that your app fulfills the promise of the search query that led them here.
* **In-App Content & Reviews:** While not directly under your control for keywords, these elements can influence discoverability indirectly. **User reviews** containing certain keywords do *not* directly boost your search ranking (Apple doesn’t index review text for search results). However, potential users often glance at reviews; if they see others mentioning the feature or use-case they care about (e.g. “...this app is the best *budget planner* I’ve used...”), it reinforces relevancy. You can encourage satisfied users to mention specific positive use cases in reviews (organically, of course) – but never fake or force this. Additionally, ensure your **in-app content and onboarding** align with the expectations set by your keywords. If you heavily target “budgeting” related keywords, for instance, the app should indeed have robust budgeting features, or you risk bad reviews from disappointed users (which *do* affect ASO via ratings). In summary, focus on **metadata for search indexing**, and use **description and reviews for confirmation and conversion** – together maximizing discoverability and download likelihood.

By carefully structuring your title, subtitle, and keywords field as above, you make your app highly indexable for the terms that matter, while keeping the presentation user-friendly. Once these changes are live, the next step is to see how they perform.

## Step 4: Deploy and Track Keyword Rankings Manually

After updating your app’s metadata with optimized keywords, you need to **monitor how your app ranks for those keywords over time**. Tracking rankings will tell you what’s working and where to iterate. Without pricey ASO software, you can still track keyword performance using a hands-on approach:

* **Monitor Search Rankings Directly:** The straightforward method is to manually search for your target keywords on the App Store and note where your app appears in the results. For consistency, perform searches in the same environment each time: use the same device or Apple ID (or log out if you suspect personalization) and ensure you’re searching the correct country’s App Store where your optimization is focused. It may help to use an iOS simulator or a spare device dedicated to testing search results. If your app is new or ranks beyond \~100, scrolling manually is impractical – instead, utilize the **iTunes Search API** to retrieve results. By calling Apple’s search endpoint with your keyword and country, you get a JSON response of top apps for that query. You can parse this to find your app’s position if it’s within the results. For example, a query like:

  ```
  https://itunes.apple.com/search?term=<your+keyword>&country=US&entity=software
  ```

  will return a list of apps for that keyword in the U.S. If your app appears, its index in the JSON is effectively its rank. (Many ASO tools do exactly this – repeatedly query the App Store’s API for various keywords and record the rankings.) You can write a simple script or use a tool like Postman to fetch this data periodically.
* **Create a Keyword Rank Tracker Spreadsheet:** Set up a sheet with your list of keywords in rows and columns for dates. Record the rank position of your app for each keyword on a given day. Over time, you’ll have a timeline of how your rankings move. Focus on the top 50-100 results; if you’re beyond that for a term, it’s effectively not generating meaningful traffic. Update this tracking sheet perhaps once a week or every few days. (Daily fluctuations can happen, but long-term trends are more insightful than minor day-to-day changes.)
* **Track Impressions and Taps via App Analytics:** Log in to your App Store Connect **App Analytics** and look at **Acquisition > Sources** for Search. Apple provides data on how many **Impressions** and **App Store searches** led to views and downloads of your app. You can even see the top **Search Terms** that resulted in installs for your app (Apple shows a list of the most used search queries that led users to download your app). Use this data to validate your keyword strategy. For example, if after your update, the term “calorie counter” starts showing up as a top search term driving downloads, that’s evidence your optimization for that keyword is working. If a keyword you targeted isn’t showing up at all, it likely means your rank is too low for anyone to find you under that term.
* **Check Competitor and Category Trends:** As you track your own ranks, keep an eye on competitor apps for context. If possible, also note the ranks of a few key competitors for your core keywords occasionally. If a competitor suddenly jumps ahead of you or you see multiple new apps climbing, it could explain any drop in your visibility. Additionally, track your category ranking (if applicable) as an indirect indicator of overall performance, though category rank is influenced by all downloads, not just search.
* **Manual User Testing:** Another form of “tracking” is simply to periodically emulate a user’s journey. Search your keywords and see if your app’s **icon, title, and subtitle** are appealing compared to others. A low ranking might not only be due to keyword relevance, but also low conversion (if users skip over your app even when it’s visible). Take note of how your listing appears in search results: Is your title cut off? Does your subtitle communicate a compelling benefit? These qualitative checks can reveal issues that pure rank tracking might miss (for instance, you might rank #10 but still get few downloads if #1–#9 have much more attractive listings or recognizable brands).

**Benchmark:** Generally, you want to see your app **climbing into at least the top 10–20 results** for your primary keywords over time. Being outside the top 50 means very few users will ever see your app for that query. Set goals such as “Rank in top 10 for keyword X within 2 updates” or “Achieve top 5 ranking for at least one high-volume keyword”. Tracking will show if you’re progressing toward these goals. Remember that **App Store rankings are influenced by download volume and velocity** too – so as your keywords bring in more downloads, your ranks can improve in a virtuous cycle. Conversely, if a term isn’t bringing any visibility, you may need to rethink it. Tracking data provides the feedback loop for the next step: iteration.

## Step 5: Test, Learn, and Iterate Your Keyword Strategy

App Store Optimization is **not a one-time task, but an ongoing process**. Armed with the data from your tracking and analytics, regularly refine your keyword approach to improve results. Here’s how to iterate effectively without external tools:

* **Analyze Performance Data:** Look at your tracking spreadsheet and App Store Connect metrics after each app update or metadata change. Identify which keywords are **performing well** – e.g., those where your rank is improving or stable in the top results, and which are actually driving impressions/taps according to analytics. Also flag keywords that are **underperforming** – those stuck at a low rank (e.g. beyond 50) or not appearing in your analytics at all. For instance, you might find you’ve achieved rank #8 for “meal planner” (good) but still languish at rank #50 for “diet app” (poor).
* **Investigate the Why:** For each underperforming keyword, consider why it might be falling flat. Is it extremely competitive (dominated by apps with millions of downloads)? Is it perhaps not as relevant as you thought (users searching that term aren’t clicking your app)? Or did you possibly not include it optimally (e.g., it’s only in the keyword field, and maybe it needs to be elevated to subtitle to carry more weight)? Also examine if a competitor is consistently outranking you – what do they have that you don’t (more downloads, better rating, or the keyword in their title while you only had it in keywords field)? This analysis will inform your next adjustments.
* **Adjust Keyword Targeting in Updates:** Plan an update of your metadata to replace or tweak the keywords that aren’t working. **Swap out low-performing keywords** with new candidates from your research backlog. Focus on the “opportunity” keywords – those your competitors use but you haven’t, or new trends that emerged. Also, **double down on winners**: if a keyword is doing very well in the keyword field, you might integrate it into the visible subtitle or title in the next version to give it even more weight (provided it fits naturally). Conversely, if a keyword in your subtitle isn’t yielding results, consider removing or replacing it in the subtitle with a better term next time. Remember, you can only change title/subtitle/keywords by submitting a new app update. Try not to change too many elements at once; it’s easier to measure impact if you make moderate, deliberate changes. For example, you might update 5-7 keywords out of 10, rather than a completely new set, so you can track which changes had effects.
* **Run Iterative Tests:** If you have the flexibility, you can experiment with different keyword strategies in successive updates. One technique is to try a **different subtitle phrasing** in the next release and compare metrics. (Apple now allows **Product Page Optimization** tests for creatives but not for metadata text; however, you can simulate an A/B test by rotating changes in sequential releases and observing the before/after data.) For example, Version 1 might have subtitle “Budget and expense tracker”, Version 2 might try “Manage your budget & expenses”. If you see a notable uptick in search impressions for “expense tracker” after V2, that subtitle phrasing might be resonating more with the algorithm or users.
* **Keep an Eye on Trends:** User search behavior can change with trends and seasons. Regularly repeat **Step 1 research** in case new popular search queries have arisen. Also monitor if any new competitor apps show up and what keywords they target. Sometimes an emerging trend (e.g. a new fitness fad like “HIIT workouts”) can introduce high-traffic keywords that you might want to incorporate. Being early to include a rising search term can give you a big advantage.
* **Avoid Keyword Stuffing or Irrelevance:** In the quest to improve, don’t be tempted to stuff more instances of a keyword or add unrelated trending terms. Apple’s algorithm is smart about relevance and user engagement. For example, adding a popular but irrelevant keyword might get you a brief increase in impressions, but those users will ignore or downrate your app, which **hurts you in the long run**. Quality of traffic is more important than quantity. It’s better to have moderately searched keywords that convert well for your app than high-volume keywords that lead to no installs.
* **Measure, Adjust, Repeat:** After each update, give it some time (a few weeks) to gather data, then cycle through analysis again. Look at how your changes affected rankings and downloads. **Regularly updating your keywords and metadata is necessary to maintain and improve visibility**, as the market and competition evolve. Make ASO iteration part of your release schedule – even if you don’t have major feature changes, an update solely to refine keywords and screenshots every few months can yield benefits. Keep notes of what you changed and the impact seen, so you learn over time what strategies work best for your app.

By continually testing and iterating, you effectively run a perpetual improvement loop for your ASO. Over time, this can significantly compound your app’s organic growth. As one ASO expert insightfully put it: **treat ASO as a long-term investment that you refine as you gather more data**. Patience and persistence are key – small tweaks might not skyrocket downloads overnight, but incremental gains in several keywords add up to a meaningful uplift.

## Step 6: Expand and Optimize for Localization (Multi-Language ASO)

If your app serves users in different regions or languages, **localizing your keyword strategy** can dramatically broaden your reach. Apple allows you to provide separate metadata (title, subtitle, keywords, etc.) for different App Store locales (languages/regions). Here’s how to make the most of localization for ASO:

* **Localize for Each Target Language:** Research keywords in the local language just as you did for English. Users in each country will search in their own language (e.g. Japanese users search in Japanese). Translate or transcreate your app’s metadata so that it includes the top keywords in that language. This often means working with a native speaker or doing careful research, because direct translation might miss local terminology. For example, an English finance app might target “budget” and “expense”, but in Spanish markets you’d use “presupuesto” and “gastos”. Use local App Store suggestions and check top local competitor apps to find the right terms. **Adapt to cultural differences** – keywords must reflect what locals call things (e.g., “soccer” in US vs “football” elsewhere).
* **Leverage Cross-Localization Opportunities:** A unique aspect of the App Store is that certain locales’ keywords are indexed in other countries’ searches. This is sometimes called **cross-localization** or secondary locale indexing. For instance, the U.S. App Store will index keywords from both the **English (US)** metadata *and* the **Spanish (Mexico)** metadata of your app. This means by adding a Spanish (Mexico) localization to your app (even if you don’t localize the app’s content fully), you effectively get an *extra 100 characters* of keywords that can rank in U.S. searches. You can use this strategically: many U.S. developers fill the Spanish (Mexico) localization’s keyword field with additional English keywords that didn’t fit in the main listing. **Important:** only do this if you are not targeting Spanish-speaking users in the U.S. – because using English keywords there means Spanish speakers won’t find you in Spanish. It’s a trade-off: use the secondary slot for more English keywords *only* when you don’t intend to cater to that secondary language audience. This tactic can substantially increase your keyword footprint in a given market. For example, **adding Spanish (Mexico) locale with English keywords doubles your keyword count for the U.S.** (200 characters total instead of 100). Other regions have similar pairings (Canada indexes English and French, Switzerland indexes multiple languages, etc.). In Switzerland’s App Store, keywords from English, German, French, and Italian localizations all count, giving you up to **500 characters worth of keywords** if you localize in all those languages.
* **Don’t Duplicate Across Locales:** Each localization’s keywords are indexed separately and **Apple will not form search phrases by combining words from different languages**. This means you should treat each locale’s keyword list as its own contained set. Do not repeat a keyword in both the primary and secondary locale for the same country, as that wastes space. Instead, use the secondary locale to **complement** the primary. For example, in the U.S. English (US) + Spanish (Mexico) case: if your English keywords cover “budget, finance, money, expense” and you have additional ones like “spending, tracker, saving” that didn’t fit, you could put those extras in the Spanish(Mex) keyword field in English. But you wouldn’t put “budget” again in Spanish(Mex) if it’s already in English(US) – that yields no benefit. Also, avoid splitting phrases across locales hoping Apple will join them (they won’t). Each locale should fully contain any phrase it needs.
* **Localize Titles/Subtitle Thoughtfully:** If you are truly localizing for users (and not just using a slot for more English), translate the app name and subtitle in a way that makes sense in that language *and* includes local keywords. Often the top keywords in another language won’t be direct translations of your English ones. Do the same competitor analysis in each major locale – who are the top apps and what words do they use? For example, a “to-do list” app in English might find in Germany that people search “Aufgaben” (tasks) more than a direct “to-do” translation. You might then title your app “Meine Aufgaben – \[Brand]” in German to hit that term. Ensure the localized metadata is high-quality (bad translations can hurt conversion – users can tell).
* **Consider Localization Priority:** If you have limited resources, prioritize localizations by market size and relevance. The **Primary App Store languages** (with big audiences) include English, Chinese, Spanish, Japanese, German, French, etc. If your app has a global appeal, localizing into the top languages can greatly increase discoverability. Even within one country, offering multiple localizations can capture more searches. For example, in Canada, both English (Canada) and French (Canada) metadata are indexed – by providing both, you cover both English and French search queries in Canada.
* **Test and Iterate Per Locale:** Just as you track and refine your English keywords, do so for each locale you invest in. Use country-specific App Store search (or API calls with the `country` parameter) to track your ranks in those regions. Check App Analytics with filters by country to see how your search impressions and conversions are trending internationally. Each locale might need its own tweaks over time – ASO is a local game too. For instance, you might discover your app ranks well in Japan for one term but poorly for another, leading you to adjust the Japanese keywords in the next update separately from your English changes.
* **Benefit from Global Synergy:** Improving search performance in one country can sometimes lift overall downloads (which can indirectly help in other countries due to higher download counts and reviews). And some keywords (especially brand names or English terms) might be used across languages. By having a presence in multiple locales, you also improve the chances of getting featured or noticed by Apple’s editorial team in various regions, though that’s beyond pure keyword ASO.

In summary, **localization can greatly expand your app’s reach** if done properly. It’s not just translation, but also optimization for each market’s language and search behavior. Whether you fully localize the app or simply use additional locales to stuff more keywords (the latter is useful for single-language apps wanting more keyword space in a given country), make sure to follow Apple’s guidelines and use each locale’s 100-character keyword field to your advantage. This advanced tactic can be a game-changer for visibility: for example, using Spanish(Mexico) keywords in the US App Store to rank for additional English terms is a **commonly used ASO trick**. Just remember to keep monitoring performance in each locale and refine as needed, just like you do in your primary language.

## Conclusion

Optimizing for App Store keywords manually is certainly a time-intensive endeavor, but it empowers you to deeply understand your app’s discoverability and your users’ search habits. By **researching keywords thoroughly**, **studying competitors’ strategies**, **structuring your metadata with best practices**, and **continuously tracking and iterating**, you create a robust ASO framework that doesn’t rely on expensive tools – only on data you can gather yourself. This guide’s methodology is applicable to any app category, because it focuses on core principles: know what your users search for, make sure those terms are in your app listing, and keep fine-tuning for improvement.

Remember that ASO is an ongoing process: the app marketplace is dynamic with new apps, shifting trends, and algorithm changes. Commit to regular check-ups and updates. Over time, even small gains (a few ranks up here, a new keyword there) accumulate into significant growth in organic downloads. And organic downloads are extremely valuable – they’re cost-free and often high-quality users who found you by intent. By mastering manual keyword optimization, you give your app the best chance to **be discovered by the right users** and to **grow sustainably** on the App Store, one search query at a time. Good luck, and happy optimizing!
