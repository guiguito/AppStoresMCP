Got it. I’ll break down how major ASO tools estimate keyword traffic and ranking difficulty for both the iOS App Store and Google Play. I’ll also include insights on what data sources they use, what kind of models they might run, and how you might replicate a simpler version of those features as a solo developer.

I’ll get back to you with a comprehensive breakdown soon.


# Estimating Keyword Search Volume (Traffic) and Difficulty in ASO Tools

## Introduction

App Store Optimization (ASO) tools like AppTweak, Sensor Tower, and MobileAction provide two key metrics for every search term: **search volume (traffic)** and **keyword difficulty**. **Search volume** (or traffic) indicates how often users search for a given keyword on the app stores, while **keyword difficulty** reflects how competitive it is to rank highly for that keyword. ASO practitioners rely on these metrics to prioritize keywords that can drive downloads (high volume) but are still within reach (manageable difficulty). Understanding how these tools derive these metrics can help developers interpret the numbers and even devise their own estimation methods.

&#x20;*Example of an ASO tool’s keyword metrics interface (Sensor Tower). The keyword “chat” has a **Traffic** score of 6.1 (on a 1–10 scale) indicating high search volume, and **Difficulty** around 5.6–5.9 for iPhone/iPad, meaning moderate competition. The tool also shows how many apps rank for this term (thousands of competing apps on iPhone). These metrics give a quick snapshot of a keyword’s popularity and competitiveness, helping developers gauge the potential value of targeting “chat” in their metadata.*

## Keyword Search Volume Estimation (Traffic)

**Keyword search volume** represents how much user search traffic a term receives on an app store. Since Apple and Google handle search data differently, ASO tools use different data sources and models for each platform:

### Apple App Store (iOS)

On iOS, ASO tools can leverage **real search data from Apple**. Apple provides a metric called *Search Popularity* in the Apple Search Ads platform, which reflects the relative search volume of a keyword on the App Store. Major ASO tools typically tap into this data. For example, AppTweak’s “Volume” metric is directly based on Apple’s Search Popularity score on a scale from 5 to 100. A value of 5 is minimal traffic, while 100 indicates one of the most-searched terms. In practice, common keywords fall somewhere in the middle (AppTweak noted the average keyword in the U.S. is around 27 on this scale). Tools like Sensor Tower use a simplified scale (e.g. 1 to 10) for traffic, but it correlates with the same concept – higher number means more people search that term.

To obtain these numbers, ASO platforms query Apple’s Search Ads API or scrape the data from Apple’s ad planning tools. Apple’s data is based on actual user searches, so for iOS keywords the **volume metric is grounded in real-world search frequency**. However, Apple doesn’t reveal the raw search counts – the popularity score is relative and capped at 100. The score is also not linear (the difference between 5 and 15 isn’t the same magnitude as 85 to 95 in terms of users). Still, it provides a reliable point of reference: for instance, a keyword with 60 is searched much more often than one with 20. Some ASO tools may further refine these by tracking trends over time or normalizing across countries, but the core data source for iOS is Apple’s own popularity index. In summary, **for the App Store, “traffic” scores are typically as accurate as Apple’s official search popularity data**, making them a solid indicator of relative search volume among iOS users.

### Google Play Store (Android)

On Google Play, **no official search volume statistic is published by Google**. This means ASO tools must estimate Android keyword traffic using proxy data and custom models. Different tools take different approaches, often combining multiple signals:

* **Google Play search suggestions**: If you start typing in Google Play, the autocomplete suggestions give clues to popular searches. Tools can scrape these suggestions to see which terms appear and in what order. A keyword that appears as a suggestion (especially after typing only a few letters) is likely to have significant search volume. Some ASO practitioners even gauge popularity by how quickly a term shows up in autocomplete (fewer characters needed can indicate a more popular query).
* **Web search and Google Trends**: Some tools incorporate data from Google’s Keyword Planner or Google Trends to approximate interest in a term. For example, they might look at how often a term is searched on Google web search, assuming popular app queries on the Play Store correlate with popular web queries. However, this method has limits – mobile app store searches don’t always mirror web searches. In fact, one analysis found that Google Trends and AdWords data sometimes disagree with each other and with actual app store trends, highlighting the challenge of using web data as a proxy for Play Store searches.
* **Third-party usage data**: Established ASO companies sometimes have their own data feeds. For instance, Sensor Tower and others might have a panel of Android users or partnerships that collect anonymized data on app installs and searches. They could use install spikes or other signals to infer which keywords are driving downloads. These proprietary datasets are not public, but they help the tool calibrate volume scores.
* **App Store cross-overs**: In some cases, a tool might partially inform Android volume by looking at iOS popularity. If a keyword is extremely popular on the App Store, it’s likely also popular on Google Play (though not always, due to demographic differences). The tool might use iOS as a baseline and adjust for Android-specific factors.

Each ASO tool ultimately synthesizes these inputs into a **relative volume score for Google Play keywords**, often on a 0–100 scale similar to iOS. For example, if “chat” is a highly searched term on Android, a tool might give it a volume 90/100, whereas a niche term like “secure farming app” might be 5/100. It’s important to note these Android volume scores are **estimates, not direct measurements**. They are useful for comparing keywords (e.g. “chat” vs “messenger” which is searched more?), but the actual number of searches is unknown. Accuracy will vary: the top-tier tools continuously refine their models with more data, so their estimates tend to be reasonable in ranking keywords by popularity. But the **margin of error can be significant**, especially for mid-tier keywords. Treat Android search volume metrics as approximate indicators – they can tell you which keywords are *likely* high or low volume, but not an exact traffic count.

## Keyword Ranking Difficulty Estimation

**Keyword difficulty** (sometimes called competition or chance) measures how hard it would be for an app to rank well for a given search term. Since neither Apple nor Google assigns an official “difficulty” value, ASO tools derive this metric from various competitive factors on each platform. Typically expressed on a scale (e.g. 1 to 10, or 1 to 100), a higher difficulty score means the keyword is **more competitive**, implying that strong, established apps occupy the top search results. We’ll look at how tools calculate this for the App Store and Google Play:

### Apple App Store (iOS)

On the App Store, keyword difficulty is an **ASO tool-defined metric** built from analyzing the search results for that keyword. AppTweak’s difficulty, for instance, is a 1–100 score that reflects the “level of competition” – a high score means *“powerful apps rank in the top 10 search results, making it more difficult to rank high for the keyword”*. What makes an app “powerful” in this context? Several factors are considered:

* **Number of competing apps**: A keyword targeted by many apps is naturally harder to break into. If thousands of apps show up for a search query, the difficulty is higher than for a query that only returns a few dozen results. In fact, many ASO tools base a large part of the difficulty score on how many apps are already ranking for that keyword. A very high number of search results signals intense competition.
* **Strength of top-ranking apps**: Tools evaluate the leading apps for the keyword. If the top 10 results include big-brand apps or ones with millions of downloads and hundreds of thousands of reviews, the keyword is very competitive. These apps have strong weight in Apple’s algorithm (thanks to their popularity and user engagement), so unseating them is difficult. In contrast, if the apps ranking on page 1 are relatively unknown or have small download counts, the keyword is less competitive.
* **Keyword relevance and optimization**: The tool also checks how well optimized the top apps are for that keyword. For example, do the top apps actually have the keyword in their title or subtitle? If all the top-ranking apps include the exact keyword in their name, it indicates a highly contested term – everyone is trying to rank for it. If none of them include it (perhaps they rank due to category or other factors), it might be a sign that a newcomer could still squeeze in by using the keyword explicitly. Additionally, if an app’s **metadata** is very polished (good description, updates, etc.), it contributes to competition level.
* **User ratings and performance**: Highly-rated apps or those with a lot of positive reviews in the top results can make ranking harder. Apple’s search algorithm likely favors apps with better ratings and retention. So, if you see all top results are 4.8-star apps with thousands of reviews, a new app will have a tough time outranking them. Tools factor this into difficulty by implicitly saying “the quality bar is high for this keyword”.

Using these factors, ASO tools apply a formula or machine learning model to output a difficulty score for the keyword. While the exact formulas are proprietary, the logic is to quantify how *entrenched* the current leaders are. For example, Sensor Tower historically provided a difficulty score on 1–10 for iPhone and iPad separately. An extremely competitive word like “games” might be a 9+ (since countless apps target it, and top results are giants), whereas a niche term could be a 2 or 3. Some tools present this as a percentage or as labels like “Easy/Medium/Hard” in addition to numeric values. It’s worth noting that iPhone and iPad search results can differ slightly, so difficulty can be device-specific in iOS – though in recent years Apple’s algorithms have become more uniform across devices. Overall, **on iOS a high difficulty score means a large number of apps and very strong competitors are in your way**, whereas a low score suggests an opening where a well-optimized new app might rank.

### Google Play Store (Android)

For Google Play, keyword difficulty is calculated in much the same spirit – it assesses the competitive landscape for that search term on the Android store. The factors considered are analogous to iOS, with a few Android-specific twists:

* **Volume of competition**: The sheer count of apps appearing in the search results matters. If you search a popular term on Google Play, you might get hundreds or thousands of results. ASO tools record how many apps they can find for each keyword (often by scraping multiple pages of results). A higher count contributes to a higher difficulty score. A keyword that only yields a small set of apps (say under 50) is relatively low competition.
* **Top app strength (installs & ratings)**: Google Play publicly displays the install range (e.g. “10M+ downloads”) for many apps, which is a strong indicator of an app’s size. An ASO tool will note if the top apps for a keyword each have millions of installs. Those keywords are tough because Google’s algorithm heavily favors apps with high install volume and good user retention. Also, as on iOS, the average rating and number of reviews for the top apps are considered – keywords dominated by 4.5★ apps with many reviews are high difficulty. If the top results include apps with fewer downloads or mixed reviews, that suggests an easier keyword.
* **Keyword usage and relevance**: On Google Play, apps can rank for keywords even if the exact term isn’t in the title, since Google’s search algorithm semantically parses descriptions and uses other signals. ASO tools may examine whether the keyword (or close variants) appear in the title or description of top-ranking apps. If all the top apps have that keyword in their title/name, it’s clearly a targeted term, implying higher competition. If not, perhaps the keyword is more “up for grabs” if one were to optimize for it.
* **Category and branding**: Another subtle factor is whether the keyword is a branded term or a generic term. If the keyword is something like “Facebook” or “Instagram,” the competition is essentially unwinnable for other apps – the official app will dominate. Tools often flag branded keywords separately (since ranking #1 is unrealistic unless you are that brand). For generic terms, the presence of big brand apps (like a Facebook app ranking for “messenger”) still raises difficulty. MobileAction’s glossary confirms difficulty accounts for **competitors’ strength in terms of downloads, reviews, and other quality signals** – on Android, download counts are a key strength indicator.

After gathering these data, the tool computes a difficulty score (usually 0 to 100 on Android as well). A keyword like “photo editor”, with thousands of results and top apps in the 100M+ downloads range, will score very high on difficulty. A very niche keyword like “bird watching calendar app” might score extremely low because few apps target it and none are heavyweights. Keep in mind that **Google’s search algorithm is different from Apple’s**, so sometimes an app can rank on Android by optimizing its description even if it’s new – but the difficulty score will still warn you if the incumbents are strong. The output from different tools may vary slightly (each has its own formula), but in general **a high difficulty means fierce competition on Google Play, while a low difficulty suggests a better chance for a new entrant to rank.**

## Data Sources and Accuracy of These Metrics

**Data sources used by ASO tools:** To summarize, for search volume on iOS the primary source is Apple’s own search data (via Search Ads Popularity), which makes iOS volume metrics relatively trustworthy in terms of showing real user interest. On Android, tools must get creative – using indirect signals like search suggestions, web search trends, and any proprietary usage data they have, as discussed. Both for iOS and Android, ASO tools also scrape the app stores to gather supporting data: for example, they fetch the *number of search results* for a keyword, which is often displayed or can be computed by loading all result pages. They also retrieve metadata of top-ranking apps (ratings, ranks, descriptions, etc.) to feed into difficulty algorithms. Some tools integrate with developer accounts (App Store Connect, Google Play Console) to gather **real performance data** – for instance, if many apps connected to the tool report that they get installs from a certain keyword, the tool can use that to refine its volume estimates. However, those console data are app-specific and limited, so the broader volume still largely comes from the methods described earlier.

**Models and heuristics:** Each ASO platform has its proprietary model to combine these data points. Initially, many used simpler heuristics – e.g. a *Keyword Effectiveness Index (KEI)* borrowed from SEO (which balances volume and competition numbers) or rules like *“if top apps have X downloads, mark difficulty high.”* Over time, these have evolved. Modern tools likely use machine learning, trained on historical outcomes (did apps with certain profiles manage to rank for a keyword?), to predict difficulty and even expected downloads from ranking. For example, AppTweak advertises an AI engine (“Atlas AI”) that presumably helps refine metrics like *Max Reach*, which estimates how many impressions you could get at a given rank. Despite advanced modeling, a lot of the output still boils down to a **score or color code that simplifies a complex reality** for the user. It’s an informed approximation rather than a precise measurement.

**Accuracy and reliability:** Both keyword volume and difficulty scores should be treated as **relative indicators** rather than exact values. Volume metrics tend to be more consistent across tools when ranking keywords by popularity – a term that one tool marks as high volume will usually be high volume in another tool too. This is because, at least on iOS, they’re anchored to Apple’s data, and on Android, obvious signals (like a term appearing in autosuggest for one letter) are apparent to all. However, the **exact numeric scores often differ by tool**. One tool might rate a keyword 70/100, another might say 8/10, another “High”. The differences are partly scaling and partly different data interpretations. As a Reddit discussion noted, *“the numbers are not scientific, each tool provides their own guesstimation, and those are subject to change as they get more data or alter their algo”*. In other words, these metrics are best used for comparison and decision support, not as absolute truths.

For keyword difficulty, the variance between tools can be even greater, since each has a unique way to quantify competition. One tool’s “Difficulty 30” might be another’s “Difficulty 60” for the same keyword, if their internal weighting of factors diverges. What’s important is the qualitative insight: is this keyword relatively easy, moderate, or hard to rank for? On that broad outcome, tools generally agree most of the time. They all will flag something like “free games” as very hard, and something very niche as easy. But the *thresholds* and exact scores aren’t standardized. Empirically, these difficulty scores have moderate predictive value. In a 2016 study by Incipia, the best tools could correctly predict \~67% of the time whether a new app could break into the top 10 for a keyword based on difficulty/chance metrics – better than random, but far from perfect. This underscores that **many factors (app quality, click-through rates, etc.) influence actual ranking beyond what difficulty scores capture**.

In terms of how accurate the volume metrics are: for iOS, the Apple popularity score is quite reliable in ordering keywords by volume, but it doesn’t tell you actual search counts (and Apple’s 100-point scale may be skewed toward the top end). For Android, since there’s no direct data, any numeric volume estimates should be taken with a grain of salt. Tools often won’t tell you “this keyword gets 50,000 searches a month” because they don’t know for sure; instead they provide a relative score. In practice, if you see an Android keyword marked with one of the highest volume scores in a tool, you can assume it’s *very* popular (likely a head term), and if it’s extremely low, it’s probably rarely searched. The middle ranges are fuzzier. Some tools try to validate their Android volume estimates by observing the impact on download volumes when an app’s rank changes for that keyword, but that data is hard to isolate and gather at scale.

To sum up, **the ASO tools’ metrics are useful guides but have limitations**. They are built on a mix of real data and educated guesses. They excel at relative comparisons (this keyword vs that keyword) and at identifying extremes (very high or very low values). Their absolute accuracy is improving, but developers should still combine these metrics with firsthand checks (e.g. searching the store yourself to see what apps show up, or running test Search Ads to gauge interest). The strength of these tools is saving time and crunching large data, but the metrics work best as part of a broader ASO strategy rather than as the sole decision-makers.

## DIY Approaches for Estimating Volume and Difficulty (Solo Developer)

If you’re a solo developer without a budget for premium ASO tools, you can build a **simplified version of keyword volume and difficulty analysis** using publicly available data and some scripting. While a DIY solution won’t be as polished or comprehensive, it can still provide actionable insights. Below are suggestions and approaches, along with a comparison of their complexity, data needs, and accuracy:

### Estimating Keyword Search Volume Yourself

* **Apple Search Ads data (for iOS keywords)**: Apple’s Search Ads dashboard is the most direct source of search volume info. Even if you don’t run ads, you can use a free Apple Search Ads account to query keywords. In the campaign creation interface, when you add keywords, Apple will display a Search Popularity score (5–100) for each. A solo developer can manually look up keywords this way. There are also scripts and unofficial APIs shared by the ASO community to fetch this data automatically (essentially mimicking the Search Ads interface). Using Apple’s own popularity scores gives you a solid baseline for how frequently a term is searched on iOS. **Complexity:** Low (manual lookup) to moderate (writing a script to fetch data). **Data availability:** Excellent for iOS (direct from Apple). **Accuracy:** High for relative popularity on iOS (since it’s official data). The downside is it’s limited to Apple’s ecosystem – it tells you nothing about Android.

* **Google Play suggestions and trends**: Without an official Google Play popularity metric, start by examining Google Play’s autocomplete suggestions. For example, type “chat” in the Play Store search; you might see suggestions like “chat apps, chat messenger, chat video call” etc. The presence and order of suggestions can guide you: the first suggestion is often the most searched variant. By doing this for your keywords (and even writing a small script to collect suggestions for various prefixes), you can compile a list of popular terms on Android. Additionally, use **Google Trends** for the keyword, possibly filtering to “Worldwide” and “Past 12 months” to see interest over time. If Google Trends shows a high and rising interest for a term, it likely reflects in app store searches too. You can also use the **Google Ads Keyword Planner** (set to Mobile and relevant countries) to get a rough search volume for the term on Google Search – while not specific to Play Store, it can indicate if a term is generally popular. **Complexity:** Low (manual suggestions) to moderate (writing scraper for suggestions, using Google APIs). **Data availability:** Good (suggestions and Trends are public, Keyword Planner requires a Google Ads account). **Accuracy:** Moderate. This approach will correctly identify very popular vs very obscure queries, but the lack of direct app store data means mid-level accuracy. It might miss nuance (e.g., a term could be popular in web search but not for app search or vice versa). Treat the results as a directional guide.

* **Leverage app store search APIs**: Apple provides a public Search API for the App Store (iTunes Search API). You can use it to search for apps by keyword and it returns results in JSON. One of the fields is the total number of results. This is useful: for instance, searching “chat” might return resultCount = 10,000, whereas “bird watching calendar” might return 15. While this is not exactly search volume, it tells you how many apps contain or match that term, which often correlates with how broad the term is. On Google Play, there’s no official API, but third-party libraries (like `google-play-scraper` for Node or Python) can fetch search results. Using those, you can attempt to count results as well. Additionally, by examining the top apps returned (and their download counts), you can infer popularity: if all top apps for a keyword have 100M+ installs, that keyword likely has substantial traffic (since big apps bother targeting it and sustain their ranks). **Complexity:** Moderate to high (requires coding and dealing with pagination or HTML parsing, and Google Play HTML structure can change). **Data availability:** Okay for Apple (official API), limited for Google (unofficial scraping needed). **Accuracy:** Low to moderate. The number of results and top app characteristics are indirect indicators of volume – they can sometimes mislead (a term might have many apps targeting it, yet not many user searches, or vice versa). Use this in combination with other methods for better confidence.

### Estimating Keyword Difficulty Yourself

* **Count competing apps**: The simplest difficulty proxy is to see how many apps rank for the keyword. As noted, you can get this via Apple’s API or by scraping. For a quick manual check, you can also use the App Store on macOS or the Play Store web interface: search for the term and scroll down – the more you can scroll (or the more pages exist), the more apps are competing. For example, if you have to load 50 pages of results on Google Play for a keyword, that’s a very crowded space. This count alone can be one metric: e.g., <50 results = “easy”, 50–500 = “medium”, 500+ = “hard” in terms of competition. **Complexity:** Low (manual eyeballing) to moderate (scripting the count). **Data availability:** Good (this is public info via search). **Accuracy:** Moderate. It correctly captures breadth of competition, but not the strength of that competition. 1000 weak apps might be easier to beat than 10 very strong apps – so count isn’t everything, but it’s a start.

* **Evaluate top competitors**: Take a closer look at the top 5 or 10 results for the keyword on each store. For each of these apps, gather a few data points: **download estimates**, **ratings count and average**, and whether the **keyword is in the title**. On Apple’s App Store, you can’t see download counts, but you can use the number of ratings as a rough proxy (e.g., an app with 50k ratings is likely very popular). On Google Play, the store shows a download range (e.g., 1M+, 10M+). Make a small table of the top apps: if you see metrics like “10M+ downloads, 4.7★ rating (100k reviews)” for most of them, that indicates formidable competition. Also note if these are well-known brands or games – brand-driven keywords or top-charting games are hard to displace. On the other hand, if the top apps have, say, 5k downloads or 100 reviews each and are relatively unknown, there’s an opportunity for a new app. **Complexity:** Moderate (mostly manual or using store APIs to fetch app info). **Data availability:** Good (publicly visible on store listings). **Accuracy:** High qualitative insight, moderate quantitative. This approach gives you a feel for competitor strength which is very relevant to difficulty. It’s essentially what the ASO tools are automating. You can even assign a simple score: e.g., for each top-10 app give a point if it has >100k downloads or >10k ratings (sign of strength). Count the points – if the total is, say, 8/10, difficulty is high; if it’s 1/10, difficulty is low. While simplistic, it mirrors how difficulty scores work: they reflect whether top apps are heavyweights or not.

* **Assess keyword optimization by competitors**: Check if the keyword is in the title or subtitle (on iOS) or title/short description (Android) of the top apps. If many top apps include the exact keyword in a prominent place, that means they are actively targeting it, which increases competition. If none do, it might be a side-effect keyword where the competition is not deliberately optimizing for it – an opportunity for you. Also, see if the search results are very *on-target*. Sometimes you search a niche phrase and the results are only loosely related apps (because no one directly targets it) – that implies low competition (and possibly low volume, but a focused app could rank #1 easily). Conversely, search a broad term and you get very relevant, high-quality apps, indicating many contenders have optimized for that term. **Complexity:** Low (just reading titles), could be automated with a script pulling app names. **Data availability:** Good (app metadata is public). **Accuracy:** Qualitative but useful. This helps refine the difficulty assessment by adding the *relevancy* aspect – if everyone is gunning for the keyword, it’s hard; if not, you might sneak in.

Combining the above, a solo developer could create a basic **“difficulty score” formula**. For example, one might define difficulty as: `score = (log10(number_of_competing_apps) * 20) + (average_download_tier_of_top5 * 20) + (optimization_factor * 10)`, scaled to 100. This is just an illustrative formula: *number\_of\_competing\_apps* could be the total results (log-scaled so 10 apps vs 1000 apps makes a difference), *average\_download\_tier\_of\_top5* could be a 1–5 scale based on how many downloads top apps have (e.g., 5 if most have 1M+), and *optimization\_factor* could be, say, 10 if most top apps have the keyword in title, or 0 if none do. The specifics aren’t crucial – the point is you can devise a heuristic that uses these signals. You will need to tweak any formula with a few test keywords (pick some you know are easy vs hard and see if it outputs intuitively correct rankings). **Expected accuracy:** a DIY difficulty score can correctly capture obvious cases (it will clearly mark “Facebook” as very hard and some ultra-niche term as easy). It might be less calibrated in the middle range, especially without extensive data. But it can still greatly help in comparing two keywords you’re considering – if one’s score comes out twice as high, you know it’s likely more competitive.

### Comparing DIY Approaches vs. Professional Tools

Building your own ASO keyword tool is an educational exercise and can yield useful insights, but there are trade-offs in complexity, data access, and accuracy:

* **Data Availability:** Professional ASO tools have access to data sources a solo developer usually doesn’t. Notably, Apple’s Search Popularity (for iOS volume) is accessible to everyone (you can leverage this as a solo dev, as noted), but big tools may have automated pipelines to pull this in bulk. For Google Play, the lack of official data means tools invest in gathering large datasets – for example, they might crawl millions of search suggestions or have device data from partners. As an individual, you can still use suggestions and web trends, but you’ll be sampling the surface. You might not catch seasonal spikes or country-specific trends as well as a dedicated platform. In short, **for iOS volume your DIY data is solid (Apple’s numbers), but for Google volume and for difficulty inputs, the pros simply have more data at scale**.

* **Complexity and Maintenance:** Setting up scripts to scrape the App Store or Play Store, parse results, and aggregate stats requires programming skill and time. It’s doable – especially with libraries and some open-source tools available – but it’s a mini project. More importantly, it demands maintenance: app stores change their search algorithms and page formats periodically. A script that works today might break if the HTML structure changes or if you hit anti-scraping measures. By contrast, paid ASO tools have teams ensuring their data collection adapts to changes. **A DIY solution will need continuous love and care** if you rely on it heavily. On the simpler side, using official sources like Apple Search Ads or Google’s suggestion API is more stable but still requires integration effort if you want to automate it. Overall, the complexity is moderate for a one-off analysis (a bit of coding, some CSV handling) but can become high if you attempt a full-featured tool with a nice UI and daily updates.

* **Accuracy and Insight:** A solo approach can achieve reasonably good relative estimates, but expect some loss of precision. Established ASO tools often refine their models with machine learning and validation against real outcomes (like correlating keyword volume with actual download spikes, or adjusting difficulty based on apps that unexpectedly ranked). They also sometimes incorporate factors you might overlook (e.g., perhaps Google Play gives a slight boost to newer apps for certain queries – a tool might detect that pattern). Your simpler model might treat all factors linearly or make assumptions that hold in most cases but not all. For example, your DIY difficulty might flag a keyword as easy because top apps seem weak, but maybe those apps are still ranking due to an algorithm quirk (like geo-specific relevance or high user retention) that you didn’t account for. **In general, DIY estimates will be directionally correct but with a wider error margin.** Expect that a pro tool’s “difficulty 75” might correspond to your rough calculation of “difficulty 60” for the same keyword – close, but not the same, and the pro tool might be doing a better job factoring in something like user engagement.

* **Cost vs. Benefit:** The appeal of DIY is that it’s essentially free (aside from your time and possibly some small cloud server/proxy costs for scraping). If you have a tight budget, this can be a huge benefit. You get to gather the data you need without a subscription fee. The flip side is the time investment – time that could perhaps be spent improving your app or marketing in other ways. Professional ASO tools, while pricey, give you results instantly with a high degree of confidence and lots of convenience features (tracking changes over time, filtering, suggestions, etc.). For a solo developer releasing one app, a scrappy DIY approach might suffice to choose a few good keywords. But if you’re managing multiple apps or really relying on ASO, the efficiency and depth of a tool can justify the cost. Essentially, **DIY is a good learning experience and can handle basics, whereas professional tools are optimized for reliability and depth**.

* **Ethical/ToS considerations:** It’s worth noting that scraping app store data may violate the stores’ terms of service. Big ASO companies often have arrangements or at least carefully respect rate limits to avoid legal issues. As an individual, you should be cautious – for instance, scraping hundreds of search queries on Google Play in a short time might get your IP temporarily blocked. Always use proper delays, and prefer official APIs (like Apple’s Search Ads API) when possible. This is another area where using a professional service offloads that risk (they handle data collection on their end).

**Expected accuracy of DIY vs tools:** In practical terms, if a top ASO tool can predict a keyword’s trends and difficulty with, say, 80% accuracy, a well-done DIY method might get you to 50–60%. It will correctly identify the obvious winners and losers but might mis-rank some middle keywords or miss out on dynamic changes (e.g., a surge in popularity this week because of a trending meme – which a tool might catch from data, but your static script might not). Still, for many indie developers, a rough estimate is far better than going in blind. Using public data smartly can highlight, for example, that *“keyword A is roughly twice as popular as keyword B, but also has many more competitors”* – insight that can directly inform your App Store listing strategy.

## Conclusion

In summary, major ASO platforms estimate **keyword search volume** by pulling in whatever real search data is available (Apple’s Search Popularity for iOS) and supplementing with proxy indicators for Google Play, then presenting a normalized score that ranks keywords by popularity. They estimate **keyword difficulty** by analyzing the competitive landscape – how many apps and how strong those apps are for each term – and distilling that into a competition score. These metrics, while not perfect, tend to be **good relative measures** that help developers find the sweet spot: keywords with decent traffic but not dominated by unbeatable rivals. A solo developer can replicate some of this by using public sources (like Apple Search Ads, search suggestions, store scraping, and statistical heuristics). Such a DIY approach can identify many of the same patterns (e.g., which keywords are high volume, which are high competition), albeit with less precision and more manual effort. The choice between building a home-grown solution and using a professional ASO tool comes down to resources and needs. Regardless of the approach, the core principle is the same – use data to balance **demand** (how many users search for a term) and **competition** (how hard it is to rank) when selecting keywords. By understanding how the pros estimate these metrics, even an indie developer can apply similar logic to improve their app’s visibility in both the Apple App Store and Google Play Store.

**Sources:** Key insights were gathered from ASO tool documentation and community discussions. For example, AppTweak’s API documentation confirms that iOS search volume is based on Apple’s Search Popularity score, and their difficulty metric reflects the strength of top-10 competitors. MobileAction’s glossary explains factors influencing difficulty, like number of competing apps and competitors’ download strength. A Reddit ASO thread likewise notes that many tools derive difficulty largely from how many apps rank for the keyword and use Apple’s Search Ads data for volume on iOS. Another Reddit comment reminds us that each tool’s numbers are an estimate and can vary as algorithms change. An Incipia study comparing ASO tools highlights the challenges of accurate volume estimation (especially for Google Play) and that tools often agree on relative popularity even if their exact scores differ. These sources underline that while methodologies differ, the goal is consistent: approximating how many users search for a term and how tough the competition is, on both major app stores.&#x20;
